Python Support
==============

This package currently is tested against Python versions 3.7,3.8,3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.

The current default version is 3.7 - this means that this package will not
use any features specific to versions 3.8 and later.

After End of Life of a particular Python version, support is offered on a best effort
basis. We may ask you to update your Python version to help solve the problem,
if it cannot be reasonably resolved in your current version.
